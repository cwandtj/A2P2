#
# This potential was generated to describe LiH with great accuracy
# the bond lengh is now predicted to be 1.606 to compared with 1.604
# using G03 and QZP
# the crucial point is the cutoff for the 2s wavefunction
# chosing it larger than worsens the description
# already for 1.75 the LiH bondlength increases to 1.609
